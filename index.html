    <p>We're talking away<br>
      I don't know what<br>
      I'm to say I'll say it anyway<br>
      Today's another day to find you<br>
      Shying away<br>
      I'll be coming for your love, okay?<br></p>
    <p>Take on me (take on me)<br>
      Take me on (take on me)<br>
      I'll be gone<br>
      In a day or two<br></p>
    <p>So needless to say<br>
      I'm odds and ends<br>
      But I'll be stumbling away<br>
      Slowly learning that life is okay<br>
      Say after me<br>
      It's no better to be safe than sorry<br></p>
